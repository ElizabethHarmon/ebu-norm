# ebu-norm & tp-norm
Scripts to batch normalize files to integrated or true peak targets

Prerequisites: ebur128, sox

N.B. File format input is currently limited to that readable by `ebur128` which appears to be wav, flac and ogg.

### Process
Files are analyzed by ebur128 with the required gain passed to SoX. 
+/âˆ’ gain is calculated by the target level minus the analyzed integrated or peak value.
In the case of ebu-norm, this takes place post-limiting to ensure that the exact integrated value is reached.
Files are written to a sub-folder with suffix added to filename.

### Usage: 
```shell
ebu-norm [-t target_value] infiles
```
where ```-t``` allows for an integrated target other than -23 LUFS.

As of v.0.3, if true peaks rise above -1 dBTP, a SoX limiter chain is engaged.

```shell
tp-norm [-t target_value] infiles
```
where ```-t``` allows for an true peak target other than -1 dBTP.

#### Examples

```shell
ebu-norm AudioFolder/*.wav
```
will create an ebu-norm sub-folder and create -23 LUFS integrated WAV files (default).

```shell
ebu-norm -t -20 AudioFolder/*.flac 
```
will create an ebu-norm sub-folder and create -20 LUFS integrated FLAC files. 

```shell
tp-norm AudioFolder/*.wav
```
will create a tp-norm sub-folder and -1 dBTP WAV files (default). 


```shell
tp-norm -t -2 AudioFolder/*.flac
```
will create a tp-norm sub-folder and -2 dBTP FLAC files. 

# ebu-scan
Script to batch analyze audio files and print true peak and various loudness values to screen and text file.

Prerequisites: ebur128

#### Example

```shell
ebu-scan AudioFolder/*.wav
```
Sample terminal output (and also written to analysis.txt):
```shell
File                  True Peak  Integrated  Short-term  Momentary
                      (dBTP)     (LUFS)      (LUFS)      (LUFS)
FileA.wav             -0.6       -16.8       -11.2       -9.5
FileB.wav             -1.0       -16.6       -10.9       -9.4
LongerfilenameC.wav   -0.9       -17.3       -11.7       -10.3
FileD.wav             -1.0       -17.5       -11.8       -10.5
```
